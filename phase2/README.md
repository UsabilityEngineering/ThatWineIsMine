# Phase 2: Interaction Design

# Exectutive Summary

* Using the information and research that we got in phase 1, we planned out an app with wireframes.
* The wireframes were stiched together to develop an interactive prototype on AdobeXD
* The overall design of our protoype/wireframe came from the personas and scenarios
  * **New** and **Old** wine drinkers were thought of for all steps
* **Simplicity** and **Comprehensability** were all thought of in the design
