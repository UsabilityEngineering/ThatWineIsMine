# Phase 2: Interaction Design

# Exectutive Summary

* Using the information and research that we got in phase 1, we planned out an app with wireframes.
* The wireframes were stiched together to develop an interactive prototype on AdobeXD
* The overall design of our protoype/wireframe came from the personas and scenarios
  * **New** and **Old** wine drinkers were thought of for all steps
* **Simplicity** and **Comprehensability** were all thought of in the design

# Wireframe

Having an account to save all the users trips and favorite wines and wineries. So A login page will be used for users to login with their username and password to get to their account where all their information is saved.

## Home 

Description: 

The Home page is a central location for accessing our main features of the app.  The design is supposed to be a simple grape vine for looks, but also a layout for buttons that access the rest of the app.  You can also access the settings from here in the top right corner hamburger bar.  The inspiration for this idea is to keep it simple for new users, but also show the options that older users might like.  Though the button ordering is scattered to also make all users at least scan the options and think about what they might want to do.

## Route List

Description: 

A list of all the routes to each winery will be a great help. Sometimes you want to find the nearest winery to go to, so this will be a great help to determine which winery is closer to where you are at the moment.  We kept this simple for all users, but also added a sort option in the hamburger menu to allow some more specific results.  This option is made for all users as sometimes you want other options to broaden your winery search.
