## Protocol Explanation
### Background
1. The first question confirms whether a participant had visited a winery, and gathers details about their decision process.  This information could help with the identification of enhancement and validation of current features.
2. Priorities will help determine how urgently an issue or feature might be. If multiple participants mention a tool as a high priority and a similar feature is not available, it would likely be given high priority by the product manager.
3. The third background question is meant to provide a measure of how many participants might be expected to book a tour through the app and be interested in the product.

### Task 1: Identify winery that friend can go to and bring their miniature schnauzer

The goal is to determine if a user is able to find a winery that allows pets to use the visual cue of the 'paw' icon on the Card for the winery in the wineries list.  This will determine if changes are needed to the icon to improve visibility or clarity.

### Task 2: Find a tour provider that offers a tour on Segways

The ability to use search to identify a tour provider offering a specific service will be important in closing bookings.  It is important that a participant can successfully search on a keyword when looking for a tour provider.

### Task 3: View wine label

Remembering what a wine label looks like can be helpful when hunting for a particular wine in the market.  We hope that a participant will be able to navigate to the wine details for a particular wine and intuit that tapping on the thumbnail will zoom in on the wine label.  This task may expose issues with navigation, or identify a need for an explicit visual queue for zooming in on a wine label.  

### Task 4: Finding the label from a favorite wine

Being able to use the app to find a wine you’ve tried in the past is a very important feature to encourage users to return to the app again and again.  If a participant is able to easily find a wine that they favorited then we can assume this feature isn’t too hidden to be something used commonly.  

### Task 5 Finding a popular tour according to other users

When thinking about a personality like Lauren who is new to wine and just wants to try the best, we have to make sure she can access popular tours.  When testing our popular tours feature we just need to confirm that navigation to the popular tours list is not too hard to find.
