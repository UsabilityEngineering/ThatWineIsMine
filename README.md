# That Wine is Mine

The goal of the That Wine is Mine project, is to make a learnable and memorable app that enables users to find the best wine, wineries, and wine tours in line with their preferences. Making sure the user experience is the best that we can work towards is very important in assuring usability.  The following Design Artifacts and Phases demonstrate our work so far in designing an application with consideration of the entire user experience.

* [Wireframes](phase2/artboards)
* [Prototype Draft](https://xd.adobe.com/view/323067db-e312-4884-b085-24a4b22cab8a-6763/)

# Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

* Identify what users might want to see in an app to plan wine tasting trips
  * Gather data on certain wine types and wineries
  * Include a feedback section to get user ideas
* **Online Survey** of people who enjoy wine (n=18) in our class
* **Study Documentation** look into maps and other sources of information about wine.
* Majority of respondents **wanted to go wine tasting** (55%)
* Most respondents wanted red wine and snacks to go with it. (over 50%)
* **High interest** in hiring a driver for the tour **(72%)**
* **Two major groups**
  * 2 winery visits (33.3%)
  * Visit as many wineries as possible in a day. (50%)
* Pets and golfing where **not very interesting** to the respondents
* **Design personas and scenarios** representing the 3 personas
  * John - wine collector who wants to visit multiple wineries over a weekend
  * Lauren - a new wine drinker who wants to try out a winery visit
  * Sally - an avid wine drinker whos been to wineries and wants to plan a bday party

# Phase 2: Interaction Design

* Using the information and research that we got in phase 1, we planned out an app with wireframes.
* The wireframes were stiched together to develop an interactive prototype on AdobeXD
  * We attempted to illustrate each interaction, but some interactions have limited implementation in the prototype; the heart icon for favorites can be interacted on the Winery Details screen
* The overall design of our protoype/wireframe came from the personas and scenarios
  * Lauren, Sally and John's needs were considered for all steps
* Safety, efficeincy, effectiveness, memorability, usefulness, learnabilty, error tolerance, and satisfaction kept in mind in the design of these wire frames and the flow of the prototype
* The search feature is an example of maximizing flexibility for the users where they can *__search on keywords__*
