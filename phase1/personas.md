# Team Name - That Wine is Mine

# Personas

## John

John is a wine aficionado.  He worked through college in a local tasting room and enjoyed helping during harvest whenever his schedule permitted.  After college, with a full-time income streaming in, he began collecting wines. John and his partner converted a bedroom in their home into a wine cellar complete with humidity and temperature controls.  At least once per month they hold a dinner sharing their love of wine and food with their friends.  John wants to visit as many tasting rooms as possible during his trips to wine country and keeps detailed tasting notes.  He is a member of several wine clubs and receives member shipments from leading wineries in every region he visits.  He has several favorite destinations, which offer food pairing and are always a stop when planning a weekend tasting trip to entertain out of town guests.

## Lauren

Lauren has just moved to the Bay Area not long ago and is not familiar with the area much. After she moved down to the Bay Area, she started to enjoy wine and was interested in exploring nearby tasting rooms. She is a businesswoman, after a long day of work, she wants to invite her friend for a couple of drinks at some of the local wineries. Since she just moved down there, she is overwhelmed by the number of choices. Lauren wants to visit only those tasting rooms that have her favorite wines and is not too far from her place. Also, her friend Jennifer loves pets, she cannot go anywhere without her pet. Finding a winery that allows pets is such a hassle for both of them. 

## Sally

Sally is a Mom who lives in near Oakland and really enjoys going out to the country to taste wine and hang out with her friends.  She visits tasting rooms one or two times per year and plans birthday parties with her friends in mind..  She’s not the fanciest wine drinker, but knows a little about types and what a certain region might have to offer.  She’s a fan of knowing what flavors might be a part of a tour along with how well received they were from previous tasters.  Knowing how long the trip might be and far she has to go is quite important for her since she still has kids to get back to at home.  Preferably she would like to find a trip an hour or so away from home.
