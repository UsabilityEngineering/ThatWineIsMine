# That Wine is Mine, Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

## Methods

### Questionnaire (Google Forms)

We used google forms to distribute a survey to wine consumers who would be potential users of the app.  Fourteen lickert 5-point scale questions were posed.  A significant portion of responses landed in the neutral category, and a four point scale might provided better data in the future.   One multiple choice question was used, and the split of results between two choices were somewhat contadictory.  One opened ended question was used with success to build a list of features that user considered essential.  We had eighteen respondents.

### Documentation Research

We examed avaiable maps, literature, and sites to determine what resources are currently being used by those visiting wine tasting rooms.  Users must navigate to mulitple sites to collect information they might need for any single trip.  Documentation may include a significant amount of advertising.

## Findings

* 55% of respondents indicated that they enjoy visiting tasting rooms
* 44% were neutral about sparkling wine, and 39% associated sparkling wine with celebrations
* The majority of respondents did not associate port and other fortified wines with dessert.  
* Over 50% favored red wines
* Over 50% were interested in food pairing; 17% expressed disinterest.
* Less than half of respondents expressed an interest in vineyard picnics.  30% not interested.
* More respondents were not interested in music events than were.
* Strong disinterest in golf as part of a wine tasting trip
* The response on bringing pet was fairly evenly distributed, so net neutral
* Over 30% used free maps(marketing material) to plan trips, but fewer used free magazines, so some advertising within app could be tolerated & effective
* Half of consumers wanted to pack in as many visits as possible (beyond 5 visits). But a third specifically felt two tasting rooms was the perfect number
* Integration with driver/tour services is expected to be successful, as 72% were interested or strongly interested in hiring a driver or taking a tour bus.
* Half were willing to pay for an app that made planning easy.  Only17% were opposed.
* Must have features listed by respondents:
- Free samples
- Which is the highest ranked wine tasting room
- The most popular wine of the location we are currently in
- Whereâ€™s the after party?
- food pairings, map of all local wineries, flavor profiles, general section for wines
- easy and quick way to get from one vineyard to another without waiting around too long and while also taking into account when each one is open and which ones will be the best to schedule around meal times (who offer substantial food or are within close access to food)
- Needs to be easy to use
- Include a feed where one can share their plans and meet others on their way.
- Pricing update (adding elements of the trip to a cart to see what costs will be)
- The ability to filter wineries based on which have specific types of wine (Which ones have a Cab/Merlot)
- Food pairing ideas
