# That Wine is Mine, Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

## Methods

### Questionnaire (Google Forms)

We used google forms to distribute a survey to wine consumers who would be potential users of the app.  Fourteen lickert 5-point scale questions were posed.  A significant portion of responses landed in the neutral category, and a four point scale might provided better data in the future.   One multiple choice question was used, and the split of results between two choices were somewhat contadictory.  One opened ended question was used with success to build a list of features that user considered essential.  We had eighteen respondents.

### Documentation Research

We examed available maps, literature, and sites to determine what resources are currently being used by those visiting wine tasting rooms.  Users must navigate to mulitple sites to collect information they might need for any single trip.  Documentation may include a significant amount of advertising.

## Findings

* 55% of respondents indicated that they enjoy visiting tasting rooms
* 44% were neutral about sparkling wine, and 39% associated sparkling wine with celebrations
* The majority of respondents did not associate port and other fortified wines with dessert.  
* Over 50% favored red wines
* Over 50% were interested in food pairing; 17% expressed disinterest.
* Less than half of respondents expressed an interest in vineyard picnics.  30% not interested.
* More respondents were not interested in music events than were.
* Strong disinterest in golf as part of a wine tasting trip
* The response on bringing pet was fairly evenly distributed, so net neutral
* Over 30% used free maps(marketing material) to plan trips, but fewer used free magazines, so some advertising within app could be tolerated & effective
* Half of consumers wanted to pack in as many visits as possible (beyond 5 visits). But a third specifically felt two tasting rooms was the perfect number
* Integration with driver/tour services is expected to be successful, as 72% were interested or strongly interested in hiring a driver or taking a tour bus.
* Half were willing to pay for an app that made planning easy.  Only17% were opposed.
* Must have features listed by respondents:
  * Free samples
  * Which is the highest ranked wine tasting room
  * The most popular wine of the location we are currently in
  * Where’s the after party?
  * food pairings, map of all local wineries, flavor profiles, general section for wines
  * easy and quick way to get from one vineyard to another without waiting around too long and while also taking into account when each one is open and which ones will be the best to schedule around meal times (who offer substantial food or are within close access to food)
  * Needs to be easy to use
  * Include a feed where one can share their plans and meet others on their way.
  * Pricing update (adding elements of the trip to a cart to see what costs will be)
  * The ability to filter wineries based on which have specific types of wine (Which ones have a Cab/Merlot)
  * Food pairing ideas


## Conclusions

* Lack of interest in fortified wines might present a marketing opportunity, or could represent a general lack of interest.
* A quick filter to identify food & wine pairings being offered would be valued
* Connecting users with drivers and tour buses would be seen as a valuable service by most users rather than simply an attempt to make a sale
* Use of free materials in planning trips suggests that a moderate amount of advertising may be tolerated.  A free option with ads could satisfy those who indicated they did not want to pay for an app.
* Potential features based on feedback: plan sharing, social connections, pricing info, ranking of wines, popularity ratings, filter on free vs charge tasting, and food pairing ideas from winery


## Caveats

One thing to consider is that our audience for the survey was simply who ever felt like giving us some feedback during the lab period in class.  To really get the data we want we would have to poll people who would be interested in wine and older than 21.

## Personas

### John

John is a wine aficionado.  He worked through college in a local tasting room and enjoyed helping during harvest whenever his schedule permitted.  After college, with a full-time income streaming in, he began collecting wines. John and his partner converted a bedroom in their home into a wine cellar complete with humidity and temperature controls.  At least once per month they hold a dinner sharing their love of wine and food with their friends.  John wants to visit as many tasting rooms as possible during his trips to wine country and keeps detailed tasting notes.  He is a member of several wine clubs and receives member shipments from leading wineries in every region he visits.  He has several favorite destinations, which offer food pairing and are always a stop when planning a weekend tasting trip to entertain out of town guests.

### Lauren

Lauren has just moved to the Bay Area not long ago and is not familiar with the area much. After she moved down to the Bay Area, she started to enjoy wine and was interested in exploring nearby tasting rooms. She is a businesswoman, after a long day of work, she wants to invite her friend for a couple of drinks at some of the local wineries. Since she just moved down there, she is overwhelmed by the number of choices. Lauren wants to visit only those tasting rooms that have her favorite wines and is not too far from her place. Also, her friend Jennifer loves pets, she cannot go anywhere without her pet. Finding a winery that allows pets is such a hassle for both of them. 

### Sally

Sally is a Mom who lives in near Oakland and really enjoys going out to the country to taste wine and hang out with her friends.  She visits tasting rooms one or two times per year and plans birthday parties with her friends in mind..  She’s not the fanciest wine drinker, but knows a little about types and what a certain region might have to offer.  She’s a fan of knowing what flavors might be a part of a tour along with how well received they were from previous tasters.  Knowing how long the trip might be and far she has to go is quite important for her since she still has kids to get back to at home.  Preferably she would like to find a trip an hour or so away from home.


## Scenarios

### (A) Weekend in wine country

John is visiting Sonoma county for a long weekend.  He wants to visit as many highly rated tasting rooms as possible, regardless of tasting fee.  He wants to keep a detailed tasting log for each wine he tastes.

### (B) First time wine tasting

Lauren wants to plan her first trip with her closest friend who is also new to the world of wine.  She needs suggestions on most popular wines and is price conscious, due to massive student loans.

### (C) Group outing with friends

Sally wants to invite several friends to visit her favorite wineries and share all the details about the itinerary, the wineries, and side trips she has lined up.
